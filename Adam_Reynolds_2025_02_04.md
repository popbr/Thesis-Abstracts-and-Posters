# Improving Search Queries for Researcher Productivity Assessments in Biomedical Research

Our goal with the current study was to find a solution to a few challenges faced when building a database from existing datasets.  Our research primarily focused on biomedical research, so we pulled datasets from PubMed and National Institute of Health Reporter for our database. The main challenges faced during our research were ensuring data inserted was unique, ensuring data is appropriately attributed to a researcher, and selecting attributes to help in assessing the impact of research production in a multidimensional space. As biomedical research becomes more diverse, it is difficult to determine which metrics are most impactful when analyzing the productivity of research in a multidimensional space. Our strategy to solve these challenges involves constructing and implementing our own database from existing databases. This database would allow researchers to only be added once while allowing authors to be linked to their data in the form of database attributes. Researchers' names, institutions, emails, , publication titles, grants awarded, and many more attributes will be included in our database, being linked via multiple tables. To solve the issue of uniqueness, we ensure the same person is not added by checking our database for the exact name and then performing an extra measurement in case an alias is used. Additionally, we hypothesize that using Levenshtein Distance and a dictionary data structure will disallow any duplicates or similar names. This paper introduces our current approaches and how it may be possible to utilize other information to solve these challenges that could improve research productivity and researcher quality. Our research and production of our own database helped combat the three challenges, although they are not completely resolved, yet.
